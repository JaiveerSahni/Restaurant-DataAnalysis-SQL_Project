# Restaurant Data Analysis SQL Project

This project contains a set of SQL queries designed to analyze and derive meaningful insights from a restaurant dataset. The data includes information about restaurant locations, cuisines, ratings, costs, and visitor counts.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis using SQL on the restaurant dataset. The queries answer a variety of business questions such as revenue generation, popularity, and pricing trends across different cities and restaurant chains.

---

## Key Features

- Identify restaurants with the least and highest visitors in specific cities
- Calculate maximum revenue-generating restaurants and chains
- Determine restaurants with ratings higher than average
- Find cities with the most restaurants and highest revenue
- Analyze cuisine costs to find least and most expensive cuisines
- Use advanced window functions to rank restaurants by cost and popularity
- Extract top restaurants per city based on revenue

## Queries Included

1. Find the restaurant in Delhi visited by the least number of people.
2. Identify the restaurant generating the maximum revenue across India.
3. Find the count of restaurants with ratings greater than the average rating.
4. Determine the restaurant in Delhi with the highest revenue.
5. Identify restaurant chains with the highest number of restaurant locations.
6. Calculate the total revenue generated by each restaurant chain.
7. Find the city with the maximum number of restaurants.
8. Determine the city generating the maximum revenue.
9. List the 10 least and most expensive cuisines by average cost.
10. Find the city where Biryani is the most popular cuisine.
11. Use window functions to rank restaurants:
    - By cost or pricing (overall and per city)
    - By number of visitors (ratings count)
    - Generate combined ranking labels (e.g., "CityName-Rank")
    - List top 5 restaurants per city based on revenue

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have a SQL environment with the restaurant data loaded in a table named `restaurants`.
2. Run the SQL script queries sequentially or as needed.
3. Modify the queries if needed to fit your database schema or requirements.

---

## Technologies Used

- SQL (MySQL-compatible syntax)
- Window functions (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)

---

## Dataset Assumptions

- The `restaurants` table contains fields including `name`, `city`, `cuisine`, `cost`, `rating`, `rating_count`.
- `cost` and `rating_count` are used to estimate revenue (revenue â‰ˆ `cost * rating_count`).
